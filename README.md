This project was developed for round 1 of Ode To Code event for “Techtonic 2k17” at Sinhagad Institutes, Vadgaon. It was used by about 100 students. It features User Authentication and complete MCQ test program include loading database externally, storing encrypted scores externally, countdown timer, database builder and results screen + password screen for administrator login.
This project was completed in about 30 hours due to time constraints, hence the code has scope for improvement in efficiency.
If you need any help in setting up this project or understanding the code, feel free to email me at khareatharva [ at ] gmail [ dot ] com.

Marking scheme for MCQ was +4 for right answer, +8 for wrong answer. +1 for skip. Actual score considered was deviation (from ideal score). There is no option provided to go back.

Directions to use the pre-built program:
The target resolution was 1366 x 768. Other resolutions would need proper scaling.
Store the folder /OdeToCodeFinalBuilds/unity3d in the persistent data path of Linux or /OdeToCodeFinalBuilds/unity3d/AtharvaKhare of MacOS.
For Linux: Give permissions to OdeToCode.x86_64 using the command “sudo chmod 777 OdeToCode.x86_64”.
After opening the program, left click at the "Ode To Code" Screen. Administrator login is : 
Login ID :  0
Password : 93c58d0af897
Slot : Ruby on Rails -  For result display
Slot : C#, Python, Java, SQL - For password management.
Login through administrator into C#, given Login ID between 1 and 149, and note down 6 character password for test run. If the question is "Loading", the database has not been correctly set up.
No option provided to exit, hence alt+f4 is recommended.
