This project was developed for round 1 of Ode To Code event for “Techtonic 2k17” at Sinhagad Institutes, Vadgaon. It was used by about 100 students. It features User Authentication and complete MCQ test program include loading database externally, storing encrypted scores externally, countdown timer, and results screen + password screen for administrator login.
This project was completed in about 30 hours due to time constraints, hence the code has scope for improvement in efficiency.
If you need any help in setting up this project or understanding the code, feel free to email me at khareatharva [ at ] gmail [ dot ] com.

Marking scheme for MCQ was +4 for right answer, +8 for wrong answer. +1 for skip. Actual score considered was deviation (from ideal score). There is no option provided to go back.

Directions to use the pre-built program:
The target resolution was 1366 x 768. Other resolutions would need proper scaling.
Store the folder /OdeToCodeFinalBuilds/unity3d in the persistent data path of Linux or /OdeToCodeFinalBuilds/unity3d/AtharvaKhare of MacOS.
For Linux: Give permissions to OdeToCode.x86_64 using the command “sudo chmod 777 OdeToCode.x86_64”.
No option provided to exit, hence alt+f4 is recommended.
